1. Verify the problem + the problem inputs
2. Think about the problem + derive a verbal solution (think loudy)
3. Write donw a first version (e.g. in pseudo-code)
4. Derive time complexity and see if you can improve your solution to do better

Ways of simplifying a problem:
- split into smaller sub-problems
- use console.log or breakpoints to verify what's in your (temporary) variables
- use helper variables (e.g. helper arrays to store intermediate results)

Greedy vs Dynamic approach:
Greedy:
- Make best possible decision in every step and hope that it leads to the overall best solution
- This kind of algorithms is often faster to set up and come up with but it dont necessarily provide the best runtime and/or result

Dynamic:
-evaluate all possible solutions and find overall best solution via comparison 
- "divide and conquer" approach: divide the problem into smaller, easy-to-solve subproblems

Improved "problem-solving" plan:
1. Verify inputs/problem

------ Here mayby go with a simple, greedy approach first ------
2. Think about problem + verbal solution
3. Write down a first version
----------------------------------------------------------------

4. Verify result (try different inputs)
5. Derive time complexity
6. Explore alternative approaches (back to the 2 step)
