1. Verify the problem + the problem inputs
2. Think about the problem + derive a verbal solution (think loudy)
3. Write donw a first version (e.g. in pseudo-code)
4. Derive time complexity and see if you can improve your solution to do better

Ways of simplifying a problem:
- split into smaller sub-problems
- use console.log or breakpoints to verify what's in your (temporary) variables
- use helper variables (e.g. helper arrays to store intermediate results)
